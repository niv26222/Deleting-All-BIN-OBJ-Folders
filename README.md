# Deleting-All-BIN-OBJ-Folders

Sometimes it turns out that we have to delete all bin and obj folders recursively in a Visual Studio solution . There’s a built-in Visual Studio feature called Clean Solution but it doesn’t delete them all.

# This is my way to for deleting all BIN and OBJ folders recursively.
  1.  Create an empty file and name it DeleteBinObjFolders.bat
  2.  Copy-paste code the below code into the DeleteBinObjFolders.bat
  3.  Move the DeleteBinObjFolders.bat file into the same folder with your solution (*.sln) file.
